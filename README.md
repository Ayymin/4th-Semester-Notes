# Semester 4

These are some of the notes I've written locally on my school laptop during my 4th semester. These modules covered C# .NET, Systemintegration and iOS lectures.
The C# .NET and iOS lecture notes are scarce, as I struggled with finding a reasoning for documenting extensively on it, as it was more practical than theoretical, in contrast to Systemintegration, which was a lot about the process of integrating different systems.
